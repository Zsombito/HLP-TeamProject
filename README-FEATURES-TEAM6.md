# Features Implemented: 

## Smart Channel: 
* Wires are neatly placed with least amount of crossings 
* Works in every direction, however you need to use two different shortcuts (CTRL + H) for horizontal (CTRL + J) for vertical 
    * This was done to make auto detect better
* Works with flipped/rotated components
* feature - can auto detect channels out of any components 
    * will try to place in the middle and have the biggest area without components inside
* feature - offers a choice to replace wires which have been too difficult to route
* feature - highlights components that form the channel
* feature - routes wires originating from the same port together (same net wires)
* limitation - least amount of crossing may be unachiaveble due to routing same net wires together 
* limitation - auto detect works only if the channel makes sense, if it doesnt it will still from a channel but it will cause undisiralbe effects

## Wire replacement with labels:
* Offers choice to replace selected wire(s) with labels
* Works in any orientation, flipped/rotated components
* feature - Creates popup window to enter name / confirm the replacement (CTRL + L)
* feature - Can be forced to skip popup and just replace wire(s) with auto generated name(s) (CTRL + SHIFT + L)
* feature - If only one wire is selected it can be named by user or can use generated name if no imputs have been made
* feature - For clarity reason cannot replace wire already connected to a label

## Smart Rotate:
* Blocks of selected symbols can be Rotated, Flipped or Scaled about the block center. Wires autorouted too.
* Handles invalid placements for every operation by drag and dropping or stopping scaling, with colour highlighting.
* Original keypress / edit menu for these operations kept (as in individual smart rotate).

## Scaling & Rotation UI Box:
* Created UI to perform rotation and scaling on sheet using buttons. 
* UI shows box surrounding selected components, a scaling button in the top right, and 2 rotation buttons.
* Rotate Buttons use original smart rotate - block rotation function. Scaling button uses a slightly modified scaling function to take a variable scaling factor.
* Buttons remain on the top in SVG, so they are not hidden by other symbols
* feature - Box and buttons are dynamic: they rotate and move around, as well as scale properly with the individual scaling shortcuts.
* feature - Invalid placement handled, as well as action changes from clicking elsewhere.
* limitation - sudden movements while moving selected symbols may mis align the box.

## Smart Resizing
* By clicking Ctrl+E (or Cmd+E), the two selected components are resized
* feature - if a resized symbol overlaps with another symbol in the canvas, placement is not allowed. Instead, the user must drag the symbol to an empty location and drop
* feature - works with flipped channels
* feature - a symbol can be dragged along the canvas and the Custom symbol closest to it will get selected for resizing (and highlighted in pink). Actually, it is the symbol being dragged, that will get resized, according to the standard rules (like Ctrl+E). The user still has to click Ctrl+E in order to perform the resizing action. We found it gives the user more control.
* feature - components can be resized even without any connections between them. However if the user wants the component to get shifted, there must me at least one connection between components.
* limitation - dragging symbol across the canvas always highlights the closest Custom component - no CtrlDown is required.
* limitation - does not always work with rotated symbols.

## Smart Port Order
* By clicking (Ctrl+R) on two components, ports are reordered.
* Works in any orientation/rotation
* feature - components with a select port can also be flipped if it is better to do so.
* feature - Clicking on multiple components will and then Ctrl+T, the component with the most wire connected to it will have it's ports reordered.
* Only selected components will be taken into account in the reordering
* It could reorder multiple edges at a time (select components connected to each edge)
* limitation - If an output is connected to multiple components or multiple components connected to one input the reordering with more than 2 components will have 
undefined behavior.
* limitation - For more than two components, it will only work if components connected to the same edge are connected from the same edge. (eg, all Right edges connected to the left Edge)


# TestReorderSmartChannel
* By clicking this button it test reorder and smart channel together, it basically just calls them right after each other
